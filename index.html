<!-- 2.1 Before React
In order for ReactJS to work on your app, below 2 lines should be added to HTML;
React is the library that let's us create interactive applications;
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17.0.2/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
React-dom is the library that helps us but React-created elements in the HTML body;
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17.0.2/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
-->

<!-- 2.2 Our First React Element
On ReactJS, we create elements on JS instead of HTML;
To create a span: const variableName = React.createElement("span", {propertyObj}, content);
To put the created element in HTML body: ReactDOM.render(element, destination);
For this, convention is to create a div#root as destination;
Above method is the very basic type of ReactJS and it is never used;
Key is that we don't need to work on HTML as much as before;
-->

<!-- 2.3 Event in React
To render multiple elements, we can create additional element like div
as container for multiple elements where we can put other elements as an array;
const ctn = React.createElement("div", null, [span, button]);

As a property of React-created element, we can add event listener function;
const btn = React.createElement(
      "button",
      {
        onClick: () => console.log("i'm clicked"),
      },
      "Click Me"
    );
-->

<!-- 2.5 - 2.6 JSX
JSX is a syntax extension for JS;
Using JSX, we can create React-elements similar to HTML way;
Because of JSX, developers never use previous methods of creating elements;
JSX Method: const title = <h3 id="title" onMouseEnter={() => console.log("mouse enter")}>Content</h3>

The downside of JSX is that browsers cannot fully understand JSX;
In order to make browsers understand, we need to use Babel to translate the code;

To include elements into another element, the children elements must to a function;
The functions can be included similar to HTML tags

const Container = (
      <div>
        <Title />
        <Button />
      </div>
    );

First letter of your own components should be Uppercase;
It's because if it is in lowercase, React might mistake it for HTML tag;
-->

<!-- 3.0 Understanding State
State is basically where your data will be;
To include a variable in React, we just put the varialbe in {};

When you render multiple times, React will check the update and apply to the only element that changed;
-->

<!-- 3.1 - 3.2 setState
To trigger re-render without having to call the rendering function everytime,
First, we create a React.useState(data, modifierFunction) variable;
In the process of creating the variable, we can name the arguments as below:
  
const [data, modifier] = React.useState(initialDataValue);

The modifier(newValue) function, when used, it will update the data and re-render the component;
The convention is to name the modifier as setData (Data being variable name of the data);
-->

<!-- 3.4 State Functions
When we need to calculate the next State based on the current State,
modifierFunction can take the current State as its argument;
Thus, we can make a counter as below:

const [counter, setCounter] = React.useState(0);
const onClick = () => setCounter((current) => current + 1);      
-->

<!-- 3.5 Inputs and State
HTML properties might have to use different name in JSX;
For instance class property should be className and for should be htmlFor;
This is because those are syntax that are already used in JS;
-->

<!-- 4.0 Props
React helps us create and reuse components;
The norm is to create children components and put them inside a parent component;
Props is a type of way that we can send data from parent component to the children component;

When you are placing your components, you can give them props like how you would do in HTML;
These props will be sent to each components as props object;
You can use these props objects in the children component thus making them more configurable;

You can set the whole props object as an argument: function Btn(props);
However, if you don't have many props, you can use shortcut to take it out of the props object: function Btn({text});
-->

<!-- 4.1 Memo
It is also possible to send funcitons as props;
You can define the function in the parent component and send it to children component as a prop;

In case you don't want to re-render certain component, you can use React Memo;
You simply make copy of a component using React.memo();
const MemorizedBtn = React.memo(Btn);
MemorizedBtn will copy the Btn component and will render only once;
-->

<!-- 4.2 Prop Types
React Team provides prop-types.js which checks the prop type you are sending;
It provides PropTypes object where we can define name and type of the props we are sending;
Based on the this setup, React can warn us on the console when we send a wrong type of prop;

Btn.propTypes = {
  text: PropTypes.string,
  fontSize: PropTypes.number,
};

We can also check if required prop is missing;
It is also possible to set default prop value on the components arguments;
-->
