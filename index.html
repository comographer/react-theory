<!-- 2.1 Before React
In order for ReactJS to work on your app, below 2 lines should be added to HTML;
React is the library that let's us create interactive applications;
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17.0.2/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
React-dom is the library that helps us but React-created elements in the HTML body;
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17.0.2/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
-->

<!-- 2.2 Our First React Element
On ReactJS, we create elements on JS instead of HTML;
To create a span: const variableName = React.createElement("span", {propertyObj}, content);
To put the created element in HTML body: ReactDOM.render(element, destination);
For this, convention is to create a div#root as destination;
Above method is the very basic type of ReactJS and it is never used;
Key is that we don't need to work on HTML as much as before;
-->

<!-- 2.3 Event in React
To render multiple elements, we can create additional element like div
as container for multiple elements where we can put other elements as an array;
const ctn = React.createElement("div", null, [span, button]);

As a property of React-created element, we can add event listener function;
const btn = React.createElement(
      "button",
      {
        onClick: () => console.log("i'm clicked"),
      },
      "Click Me"
    );
-->

<!-- 2.5 - 2.6 JSX
JSX is a syntax extension for JS;
Using JSX, we can create React-elements similar to HTML way;
Because of JSX, developers never use previous methods of creating elements;
JSX Method: const title = <h3 id="title" onMouseEnter={() => console.log("mouse enter")}>Content</h3>

The downside of JSX is that browsers cannot fully understand JSX;
In order to make browsers understand, we need to use Babel to translate the code;

To include elements into another element, the children elements must to a function;
The functions can be included similar to HTML tags

const Container = (
      <div>
        <Title />
        <Button />
      </div>
    );

First letter of your own components should be Uppercase;
It's because if it is in lowercase, React might mistake it for HTML tag;
